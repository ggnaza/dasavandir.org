# decisions/ — routing catalog

Decision records (`ADR-NNNN`): why we chose what. **`ADR-NNNN` is the canonical decision ID**, stable
forever; **supersession, not deletion**. Every ADR carries a mandatory `## Alternatives Considered`
field (the dead-ends ARE the value — a rejected option + why is the record's reason to exist). Entries
here carry the claim-as-carry-away **plus status**. Route by status first (don't act on a
`superseded`/`rejected` ADR), then by topic. Schema authority: `../CONVENTIONS.md`.

> **Why a decision ledger.** A non-trivial choice with its rejected alternatives written down *before*
> acting is the antidote to re-litigating settled questions and to reverse-engineering rationale after
> the fact. An ADR whose `## Alternatives Considered` was filled in afterwards is lint-incomplete.

## Entry purpose + naming

- **Purpose:** one settled decision, with the alternatives weighed and why they lost.
- **Filename:** `decisions/NNNN-<kebab-slug>.md` (zero-padded, monotonic; IDs never reused).
- **Write-discipline:** APPEND-ONLY for new ADRs; an existing ADR changes `status:` in place, never
  moves. Supersession via frontmatter (`superseded-by:` + `status: superseded`), not deletion.

## Entry SCHEMA (front-matter + body)

- Front-matter: `provenance` × `status` (`proposed` → `accepted` / `rejected` / `superseded`) ×
  `tags` × `related`. An `accepted` ADR may **not** be `provenance: llm-draft`/`llm-autonomous` — a
  human signs off before accept.
- Body: Context · Decision · **Alternatives Considered** (non-empty, authored before the work) ·
  Consequences · (optional) the work-unit (`WU-NNNN`) or open question (`OQ-NNN`) it resolves.

## Decisions (route by status, then topic)

<!-- EXAMPLE (delete this block on the first real ADR):
- ⭐ `0001-example-decision.md` — **Open when:** "why did we choose <X> over <Y>?" **Carry-away:**
  <the one-sentence decision + the load-bearing reason>; alternatives <A/B/C> rejected in-ADR.
  *(status: proposed.)*
-->

## Maintenance

APPEND-ONLY for new ADRs; existing ADRs change `status:` in place, never move (supersession via
`superseded-by:`). Adding/retiring an ADR updates this index in the SAME change. `status: accepted`
⇒ may not be `llm-draft`/`llm-autonomous`.
